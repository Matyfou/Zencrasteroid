# Getting Started

## Setting up Fabric
Asteroid Client recommends using [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org) for easily managing your Minecraft instances.

If you are using Prism Launcher, installing Fabric is as easy as creating a new instance, and selecting the latest version
of Fabric from the create instance menu.

If you are using a different launcher, Fabric has instructions [here](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/).

## Installing Asteroid
If you are using Prism Launcher, go to the mods tab of your chosen Fabric instance, click "Download Mods", "Modrinth", and search for Asteroid. Select the mod for download, and click "Review and Confirm".

Otherwise, download the latest release of Asteroid for your given version of Minecraft, from the
[Modrinth page](https://modrinth.com/mod/asteroid/versions).

Drag this file in to the mods folder of your instance.

## Using Asteroid
See the [modules section](modules/index.md) for information on how to use modules.
