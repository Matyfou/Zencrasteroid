# Macros

Asteroid allows players to create Macros, and assign keybinds to them.

Macros are a collection of messages, that when run, send to the chat in order.
This allows the player to send series of commands, or send pre-defined messages to the chat.

To create a macro, open the main menu with ++right-shift++, and navigate to the "Macros" tab.

Macros can be run using their assigned keybind, or by using the `.macro` command.
