# FAQ
## Why did you make this? What is wrong with Meteor Client?
Meteor Client is a great mod. It has so many useful utilities, and a great UI.
However, many of the features of the mod are geared to a very particular style of server.
Anarchy servers allow and encourage hacks / cheats, and Meteor does an excellent job catering to players of Anarchy servers.

However, many of the modules in Meteor are also quite useful to players of non-anarchy servers.
Asteroid hopes to provide a slimmed down version of Meteor, catered towards more traditional playstyles.

Modules that are relevant to Anarchy alone have been removed. Others that most would consider cheats / hacks have been
configured to only work when OP, or in singleplayer.

## Why are some modules labelled as a Cheat? {#cheats}
You may notice that some modules in Asteroid have been marked as being a cheat.

These modules will only be usable in Single Player, or if the player has OP.
