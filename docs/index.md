# Asteroid
## The utility focused utility client.

Asteroid is a fork / distribution of the [Meteor Client](https://meteorclient.com/), a fabric based utility client mod. It has had most of Meteor's anarchy modules removed, in order to focus entirely on the utilities. The few modules remaining that could be considered cheats can only be used when the player is OP, or in singleplayer.
